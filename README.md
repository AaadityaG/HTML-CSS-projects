# HTML-CSS-projects

Here this repo is including all the HTML and CSS beginner projects that I created to practice. 
One by one these projects are using near by all the HTML tags and CSS properties. 
These projects helped me alot to understand the basic structure of language and why the things
work the way they are working in specialy a designing part of Web-Development.
